		○ Import Form for Login
		○ Actions function navigates to Register screen
	• Register.js
		○ Import Form for Register
		○ Actions function navigates to Login screen

For some reason when I did the above I didn't see input fields email and password on the main screen so I changed app to import login and register like below
	• App.js
		○ import Routes 
		○ Import Login and Register
After this change I can see the input fields but I can't navigate back and forth..
